This repo documents my learnings, experiments, and analysis in the Go language. Each folder will represent a different project, website, book, etc. Feedback or code review is welcome via Github issues or pull requests. The best way to explore the code is through the [Godoc documentation](https://godoc.org/github.com/philipithomas/notebook).

## About Me

You can learn more about me at [my website](https://www.philipithomas.com). My background isn't computer science - it's applied math. (I majored in systems engineering and physics in college.) I'm interested in continued learning and exploring new topics.

## Why Go?

It's become my preferred language because of type safety, easy concurrency, simple deployments, and community. I also like Julia for its optimization community and Python for its data tools
