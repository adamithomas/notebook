Package lcm finds least common multiples
12 November 2014

Problem:
2520 is the smallest number that can be divided by each
of the numbers from 1 to 10 without any remainder. What is
the smallest positive number that is evenly divisible by
all of the numbers from 1 to 20?

Solution:
The least common multiple (lcm) of two numbers is fairly
straightforward to calculate, and the function is associative
such that lcm(a,b,c) = lcm(a, lcm(a,b)). I used this property
to iteratively calculate the lcm(1,2), then lcm(lcm(1,2),3), etc.
to 20.

This function uses the greatest common divisor (gcd), which is
computed recursively using Euclidâ€™s algorithm.
