Package sumsquares findes the sums of squares and square of sums

Problem:
The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is,

1^2 + 2^2 + ... + 10^2 = 385

The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is,

(1 + 2 + ... + 10)^2 = 55^2 = 3025

Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers and the square of the sum is 3025 âˆ’ 385 = 2640.

Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum.

Solution:
This operation is quite common in statistics as a variance calculation.

I chose to use go routines to calculate the sum and squares concurrently.
Only one value ends up being transmitted on squareChan before it closes,
so it may not be a traditional use of a channel, but it does allow executing
the calculation without blocking the other calculation.
